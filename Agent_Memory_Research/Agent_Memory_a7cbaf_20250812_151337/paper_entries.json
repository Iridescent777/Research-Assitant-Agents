                            "content": "We consider a simple binary market model containing $N$ competitive agents.\nThe novel feature of our model is that it incorporates the tendency shown by\ntraders to look for patterns in past price movements over multiple time scales,\ni.e. {\\em multiple memory-lengths}. In the regime where these memory-lengths\nare all small, the average winnings per agent exceed those obtained for either\n(1) a pure population where all agents have equal memory-length, or (2) a mixed\npopulation comprising sub-populations of equal-memory agents with each\nsub-population having a different memory-length. Agents who consistently play\nstrategies of a given memory-length, are found to win more on average --\nswitching between strategies with different memory lengths incurs an effective\npenalty, while switching between strategies of equal memory does not. Agents\nemploying short-memory strategies can outperform agents using long-memory\nstrategies, even in the regime where an equal-memory system would have favored\nthe use of long-memory strategies. Using the many-body `Crowd-Anticrowd'\ntheory, we obtain analytic expressions which are in good agreement with the\nobserved numerical results. In the context of financial markets, our results\nsuggest that multiple-memory agents have a better chance of identifying price\npatterns of unknown length and hence will typically have higher winnings."
