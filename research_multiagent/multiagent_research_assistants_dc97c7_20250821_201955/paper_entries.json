More recently, the Web of Things\n(WoT), which is an extension of the Internet of Things (IoT) with metadata\nexpressed in Web standards, and its community provide further motivation for\npushing the autonomous agents research agenda forward. Although representing\nand reasoning about norms, policies and preferences is crucial to ensuring that\nautonomous agents act in a manner that satisfies stakeholder requirements,\nnormative concepts, policies and preferences have yet to be considered as\nfirst-class abstractions in Web-based multiagent systems. Towards this end,\nthis paper motivates the need for alignment and joint research across the\nMultiagent Systems, Semantic Web, and WoT communities, introduces a conceptual\nframework for governance of autonomous agents on the Web, and identifies\nseveral research challenges and opportunities."
