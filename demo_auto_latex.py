Reinforcement learning (RL) is a subfield of machine learning that focuses on training agents to make sequential decisions in an environment to maximize cumulative rewards.

\\section{Core Concepts}
\\subsection{Agent and Environment}
In reinforcement learning, an agent interacts with an environment by taking actions and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties.

\\section{Conclusion}
Reinforcement learning represents a powerful paradigm for autonomous decision-making systems.
