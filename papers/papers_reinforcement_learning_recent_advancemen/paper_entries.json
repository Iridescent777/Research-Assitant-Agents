Recent works have\ndemonstrated the remarkable successes of deep reinforcement learning in various\ndomains including finance, medicine, healthcare, video games, robotics, and\ncomputer vision. In this work, we provide a detailed review of recent and\nstate-of-the-art research advances of deep reinforcement learning in computer\nvision. We start with comprehending the theories of deep learning,\nreinforcement learning, and deep reinforcement learning. We then propose a\ncategorization of deep reinforcement learning methodologies and discuss their\nadvantages and limitations. In particular, we divide deep reinforcement\nlearning into seven main categories according to their applications in computer\nvision, i.e. (i)landmark localization (ii) object detection; (iii) object\ntracking; (iv) registration on both 2D image and 3D image volumetric data (v)\nimage segmentation; (vi) videos analysis; and (vii) other applications. Each of\nthese categories is further analyzed with reinforcement learning techniques,\nnetwork design, and performance. Moreover, we provide a comprehensive analysis\nof the existing publicly available datasets and examine source code\navailability. Finally, we present some open issues and discuss future research\ndirections on deep reinforcement learning in computer vision"

Reward engineering involves\ndesigning reward functions that accurately reflect the desired outcomes, while\nreward shaping provides additional feedback to guide the learning process,\naccelerating convergence to optimal policies.
