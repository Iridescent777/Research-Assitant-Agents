Recent works have\ndemonstrated the remarkable successes of deep reinforcement learning in various\ndomains including finance, medicine, healthcare, video games, robotics, and\ncomputer vision. In this work, we provide a detailed review of recent and\nstate-of-the-art research advances of deep reinforcement learning in computer\nvision. We start with comprehending the theories of deep learning,\nreinforcement learning, and deep reinforcement learning. We then propose a\ncategorization of deep reinforcement learning methodologies and discuss their\nadvantages and limitations. In particular, we divide deep reinforcement\nlearning into seven main categories according to their applications in computer\nvision, i.e. (i)landmark localization (ii) object detection; (iii) object\ntracking; (iv) registration on both 2D image and 3D image volumetric data (v)\nimage segmentation; (vi) videos analysis; and (vii) other applications. Each of\nthese categories is further analyzed with reinforcement learning techniques,\nnetwork design, and performance. Moreover, we provide a comprehensive analysis\nof the existing publicly available datasets and examine source code\navailability. Finally, we present some open issues and discuss future research\ndirections on deep reinforcement learning in computer vision"

Despite\nits reputation, data inefficiency caused by its trial and error learning\nmechanism makes deep reinforcement learning hard to be practical in a wide\nrange of areas. Plenty of methods have been developed for sample efficient deep\nreinforcement learning, such as environment modeling, experience transfer, and\ndistributed modifications, amongst which, distributed deep reinforcement\nlearning has shown its potential in various applications, such as\nhuman-computer gaming, and intelligent transportation. In this paper, we\nconclude the state of this exciting field, by comparing the classical\ndistributed deep reinforcement learning methods, and studying important\ncomponents to achieve efficient distributed learning, covering single player\nsingle agent distributed deep reinforcement learning to the most complex\nmultiple players multiple agents distributed deep reinforcement learning.\nFurthermore, we review recently released toolboxes that help to realize\ndistributed deep reinforcement learning without many modifications of their\nnon-distributed versions. By analyzing their strengths and weaknesses, a\nmulti-player multi-agent distributed deep reinforcement learning toolbox is\ndeveloped and released, which is further validated on Wargame, a complex\nenvironment, showing usability of the proposed toolbox for multiple players and\nmultiple agents distributed deep reinforcement learning under complex games.\nFinally, we try to point out challenges and future trends, hoping this brief\nreview can provide a guide or a spark for researchers who are interested in\ndistributed deep reinforcement learning."

Modern networks, e.g.,\nInternet of Things (IoT) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) networks, become\nmore decentralized and autonomous. In such networks, network entities need to\nmake decisions locally to maximize the network performance under uncertainty of\nnetwork environment. Reinforcement learning has been efficiently used to enable\nthe network entities to obtain the optimal policy including, e.g., decisions or\nactions, given their states when the state and action spaces are small.\nHowever, in complex and large-scale networks, the state and action spaces are\nusually large, and the reinforcement learning may not be able to find the\noptimal policy in reasonable time. Therefore, deep reinforcement learning, a\ncombination of reinforcement learning with deep learning, has been developed to\novercome the shortcomings. In this survey, we first give a tutorial of deep\nreinforcement learning from fundamental concepts to advanced models. Then, we\nreview deep reinforcement learning approaches proposed to address emerging\nissues in communications and networking. The issues include dynamic network\naccess, data rate control, wireless caching, data offloading, network security,\nand connectivity preservation which are all important to next generation\nnetworks such as 5G and beyond. Furthermore, we present applications of deep\nreinforcement learning for traffic routing, resource sharing, and data\ncollection. Finally, we highlight important challenges, open issues, and future\nresearch directions of applying deep reinforcement learning."
