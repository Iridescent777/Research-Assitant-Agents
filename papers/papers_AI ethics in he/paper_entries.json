Addressing this critical research\ngap, this study introduces the Multi-Dimensional Ethical AI Adoption Model\n(MEAAM), a novel theoretical framework that categorizes 13 critical ethical\nvariables across four foundational dimensions of Ethical AI Fair AI,\nResponsible AI, Explainable AI, and Sustainable AI. These dimensions are\nfurther analyzed through three core ethical lenses: epistemic concerns (related\nto knowledge, transparency, and system trustworthiness), normative concerns\n(focused on justice, autonomy, dignity, and moral obligations), and overarching\nconcerns (highlighting global, systemic, and long-term ethical implications).\nThis study adopts a quantitative, cross-sectional research design using survey\ndata collected from healthcare professionals and analyzed via Partial Least\nSquares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM). Employing PLS-SEM, this study\nempirically investigates the influence of these ethical constructs on two\noutcomes Operational AI Adoption and Systemic AI Adoption. Results indicate\nthat normative concerns most significantly drive operational adoption\ndecisions, while overarching concerns predominantly shape systemic adoption\nstrategies and governance frameworks. Epistemic concerns play a facilitative\nrole, enhancing the impact of ethical design principles on trust and\ntransparency in AI systems. By validating the MEAAM framework, this research\nadvances a holistic, actionable approach to ethical AI adoption in healthcare\nand provides critical insights for policymakers, technologists, and healthcare\nadministrators striving to implement ethically grounded AI solutions."

Despite stark differences, there are core similarities\nbetween the military and medical service. Warriors on battlefields often face\nlife-altering circumstances that require quick decision-making. Medical\nproviders experience similar challenges in a rapidly changing healthcare\nenvironment, such as in the emergency department or during surgery treating a\nlife-threatening condition. Generative AI, an emerging technology designed to\nefficiently generate valuable information, holds great promise. As computing\npower becomes more accessible and the abundance of health data, such as\nelectronic health records, electrocardiograms, and medical images, increases,\nit is inevitable that healthcare will be revolutionized by this technology.\nRecently, generative AI has captivated the research community, leading to\ndebates about its application in healthcare, mainly due to concerns about\ntransparency and related issues. Meanwhile, concerns about the potential\nexacerbation of health disparities due to modeling biases have raised notable\nethical concerns regarding the use of this technology in healthcare. However,\nthe ethical principles for generative AI in healthcare have been understudied,\nand decision-makers often fail to consider the significance of generative AI.\nIn this paper, we propose GREAT PLEA ethical principles, encompassing\ngovernance, reliability, equity, accountability, traceability, privacy,\nlawfulness, empathy, and autonomy, for generative AI in healthcare. We aim to\nproactively address the ethical dilemmas and challenges posed by the\nintegration of generative AI in healthcare."
