                            "content": "In the context of surgery, robots can provide substantial assistance by\nperforming small, repetitive tasks such as suturing, needle exchange, and\ntissue retraction, thereby enabling surgeons to concentrate on more complex\naspects of the procedure. However, existing surgical task learning mainly\npertains to rigid body interactions, whereas the advancement towards more\nsophisticated surgical robots necessitates the manipulation of soft bodies.\nPrevious work focused on tissue phantoms for soft tissue task learning, which\ncan be expensive and can be an entry barrier to research. Simulation\nenvironments present a safe and efficient way to learn surgical tasks before\ntheir application to actual tissue. In this study, we create a Robot Operating\nSystem (ROS)-compatible physics simulation environment with support for both\nrigid and soft body interactions within surgical tasks. Furthermore, we\ninvestigate the soft tissue interactions facilitated by the patient-side\nmanipulator of the DaVinci surgical robot. Leveraging the pybullet physics\nengine, we simulate kinematics and establish anchor points to guide the robotic\narm when manipulating soft tissue. Using demonstration-guided reinforcement\nlearning (RL) algorithms, we investigate their performance in comparison to\ntraditional reinforcement learning algorithms. Our in silico trials demonstrate\na proof-of-concept for autonomous surgical soft tissue retraction. The results\ncorroborate the feasibility of learning soft body manipulation through the\napplication of reinforcement learning agents. This work lays the foundation for\nfuture research into the development and refinement of surgical robots capable\nof managing both rigid and soft tissue interactions.

This tutorial aims to provide a concise,\nintuitive, and practical introduction to DRL, with a particular focus on the\nProximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, which is one of the most widely\nused and effective DRL methods. To facilitate learning, we organize all\nalgorithms under the Generalized Policy Iteration (GPI) framework, offering\nreaders a unified and systematic perspective. Instead of lengthy theoretical\nproofs, we emphasize intuitive explanations, illustrative examples, and\npractical engineering techniques.

Modern networks, e.g.,\nInternet of Things (IoT) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) networks, become\nmore decentralized and autonomous. In such networks, network entities need to\nmake decisions locally to maximize the network performance under uncertainty of\nnetwork environment. Reinforcement learning has been efficiently used to enable\nthe network entities to obtain the optimal policy including, e.g., decisions or\nactions, given their states when the state and action spaces are small.\nHowever, in complex and large-scale networks, the state and action spaces are\nusually large, and the reinforcement learning may not be able to find the\noptimal policy in reasonable time. Therefore, deep reinforcement learning, a\ncombination of reinforcement learning with deep learning, has been developed to\novercome the shortcomings. In this survey, we first give a tutorial of deep\nreinforcement learning from fundamental concepts to advanced models. Then, we\nreview deep reinforcement learning approaches proposed to address emerging\nissues in communications and networking. The issues include dynamic network\naccess, data rate control, wireless caching, data offloading, network security,\nand connectivity preservation which are all important to next generation\nnetworks such as 5G and beyond. Furthermore, we present applications of deep\nreinforcement learning for traffic routing, resource sharing, and data\ncollection. Finally, we highlight important challenges, open issues, and future\nresearch directions of applying deep reinforcement learning."
