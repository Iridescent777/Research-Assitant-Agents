The\ncombination of deep neural networks with reinforcement learning has gained\nincreased traction in recent years and is slowly shifting the focus from\nsingle-agent to multiagent environments. Dealing with multiple agents is\ninherently more complex as (a) the future rewards depend on multiple players'\njoint actions and (b) the computational complexity increases. We present the\nmost common multiagent problem representations and their main challenges, and\nidentify five research areas that address one or more of these challenges:\ncentralised training and decentralised execution, opponent modelling,\ncommunication, efficient coordination, and reward shaping. We find that many\ncomputational studies rely on unrealistic assumptions or are not generalisable\nto other settings; they struggle to overcome the curse of dimensionality or\nnonstationarity. Approaches from psychology and sociology capture promising\nrelevant behaviours, such as communication and coordination, to help agents\nachieve better performance in multiagent settings. We suggest that, for\nmultiagent reinforcement learning to be successful, future research should\naddress these challenges with an interdisciplinary approach to open up new\npossibilities in multiagent reinforcement learning."

The global dynamics of\nsuch a system is determined by the nature of the local interactions among the\nagents. Since it is difficult to formally analyze complex multiagent systems,\nthey are often studied through computer simulations. While computer simulations\ncan be very useful, results obtained through simulations do not formally\nvalidate the observed behavior. Thus, there is a need for a mathematical\nframework which one can use to represent multiagent systems and formally\nestablish their properties. This work contains a brief exposition of some known\nmathematical frameworks that can model multiagent systems. The focus is on one\nsuch framework, namely that of finite dynamical systems. Both, deterministic\nand stochastic versions of this framework are discussed. The paper contains a\nsampling of the mathematical results from the literature to show how finite\ndynamical systems can be used to carry out a rigorous study of the properties\nof multiagent systems and it is shown how the framework can also serve as a\nuniversal model for computation."

                            "content": "Real-world congestion problems (e.g. traffic congestion) are typically very\ncomplex and large-scale. Multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) is a\npromising candidate for dealing with this emerging complexity by providing an\nautonomous and distributed solution to these problems. However, there are three\nlimiting factors that affect the deployability of MARL approaches to congestion\nproblems. These are learning time, scalability and decentralised coordination\ni.e. no communication between the learning agents. In this paper we introduce\nResource Abstraction, an approach that addresses these challenges by allocating\nthe available resources into abstract groups. This abstraction creates new\nreward functions that provide a more informative signal to the learning agents\nand aid the coordination amongst them. Experimental work is conducted on two\nbenchmark domains from the literature, an abstract congestion problem and a\nrealistic traffic congestion problem. The current state-of-the-art for solving\nmultiagent congestion problems is a form of reward shaping called difference\nrewards. We show that the system using Resource Abstraction significantly\nimproves the learning speed and scalability, and achieves the highest possible\nor near-highest joint performance/social welfare for both congestion problems\nin large-scale scenarios involving up to 1000 reinforcement learning agents."

A challenge in the control of active-passive multiagent\nsystems is the presence of information exchange uncertainties that can yield to\nundesirable closed-loop system performance. Motivated by this standpoint, this\npaper proposes an adaptive control algorithm for this class of multiagent\nsystems to suppress the negative effects of information exchange uncertainties.\nSpecifically, by estimating these uncertainties, the proposed adaptive control\narchitecture has the ability to recover the active-passive multiagent system\nperformance in a distributed manner. As a result, the agents converge to a\nuser-adjustable neighborhood of the average of the applied inputs to the active\nagents. The efficacy of the proposed control architecture is also validated\nfrom a human-robot collaboration perspective, where a human is visiting several\ntask locations, and the multiagent system identifies these locations and moves\ntoward them as a coverage control problem."
