This achieved\nby extending a system with support to monitor and adapt itself to achieve\nspecific concerns of interest. Communication in these systems is key given that\nin scenarios involving agent interaction, it enhances cooperation and reduces\ncoordination challenges by enabling direct, clear information exchange.\nHowever, improving the expressiveness of the interaction communication with\nMASs is not without challenges. In this sense, the interplay between\nself-adaptive systems and effective communication is crucial for future MAS\nadvancements. In this paper, we propose the integration of large language\nmodels (LLMs) such as GPT-based technologies into multiagent systems. We anchor\nour methodology on the MAPE-K model, which is renowned for its robust support\nin monitoring, analyzing, planning, and executing system adaptations in\nresponse to dynamic environments. We also present a practical illustration of\nthe proposed approach, in which we implement and assess a basic MAS-based\napplication. The approach significantly advances the state-of-the-art of\nself-adaptive systems by proposing a new paradigm for MAS self-adaptation of\nautonomous systems based on LLM capabilities."
