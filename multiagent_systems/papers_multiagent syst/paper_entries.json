MARL corresponds to the learning problem in a multiagent system in\nwhich multiple agents learn simultaneously. It is an interdisciplinary field of\nstudy with a long history that includes game theory, machine learning,\nstochastic control, psychology, and optimization. Despite great successes in\nMARL, there is a lack of a self-contained overview of the literature that\ncovers game-theoretic foundations of modern MARL methods and summarizes the\nrecent advances. The majority of existing surveys are outdated and do not fully\ncover the recent developments since 2010. In this work, we provide a monograph\non MARL that covers both the fundamentals and the latest developments on the\nresearch frontier. The goal of this monograph is to provide a self-contained\nassessment of the current state-of-the-art MARL techniques from a\ngame-theoretic perspective. We expect this work to serve as a stepping stone\nfor both new researchers who are about to enter this fast-growing field and\nexperts in the field who want to obtain a panoramic view and identify new\ndirections based on recent advances."

Techniques such as potential fields and frontier\nexploration have traditionally been employed in this pursuit, primarily\nfocusing on solitary agents. Recent advancements have shifted towards\noptimizing exploration efficiency through multiagent systems. However, many\nexisting approaches overlook critical real-world factors, such as broadcast\nrange limitations, communication costs, and coverage overlap. This paper\naddresses these gaps by proposing a distributed maze exploration strategy\n(CU-LVP) that assumes constrained broadcast ranges and utilizes Voronoi\ndiagrams for better area partitioning. By adapting traditional multiagent\nmethods to distributed environments with limited broadcast ranges, this study\nevaluates their performance across diverse maze topologies, demonstrating the\nefficacy and practical applicability of the proposed method.

The\nGillespie algorithms are popular algorithms that exactly simulate such\nstochastic multiagent dynamics when each state change is driven by a discrete\nevent, the dynamics is defined in continuous time, and the stochastic law of\nevent occurrence is governed by independent Poisson processes. In the first\nmain part of this volume, we provide a tutorial on the Gillespie algorithms\nfocusing on simulation of social multiagent dynamics occurring in populations\nand networks. We do not assume advanced knowledge of mathematics (or computer\nscience or physics). We clarify why one should use the continuous-time models\nand the Gillespie algorithms in many cases, instead of easier-to-understand\ndiscrete-time models. In the remainder of this volume, we review recent\nextensions of the Gillespie algorithms aiming to add more reality to the model\n(i.e., non-Poissonian cases) or to speed up the simulations."
